# ZOO-ANIMAL-CLASSIFICATION
## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying animals based on given features. 
The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict and classify different animal species using their characteristics.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- README.md: This file.
- Animal_Classification.Final.ipynb/: Jupyter notebooks illustrating data exploration, feature engineering, and model training processes.
## Dataset
The dataset consists of various features of animals, such as:
- Number of legs
- Habitat
- Diet type (carnivore, herbivore, omnivore)
- Average lifespan
- Body temperature regulation (warm-blooded, cold-blooded)
- The target variable is the animal species.
